when the leads are less than the number of employees , then leads per employee would be 1  initially , so accordingly, it should show that how many employees , will not receive leads



without leads =  total employee - (eachemployeelead)


 

if (active employees >= total number of leads){
    set lead per employee to 1
}


if(active employees < total number of leads){
    lead per employee = total number of leads / active employees

    and if remainder is not zero, then show that , one employee will receive remainder leads
}


if lead per employee is changed then 

Employee get Lead = total leads / leadPerEmployee ;

employeeWithoutLead = totalLead - employeeGetLead;

if(employeeWithoutLead === 0){
    then show the remainder remaining, 
    but in the case that, 

   totalLEad  - (leadPerEmployee * total employee)
}

if remainder is remaining, then show that one employee will receive remainder
